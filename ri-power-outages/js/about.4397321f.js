This is not intended to be a replacement of the official site which has a very detailed map on every outage and restoration times for specific zones. Instead, this does a roll-up to the city/town level and provides a timeline of outages throughout the day in 10 min segments. The timeline helps visualize the trend of the outages (increasing or decreasing) and is unique to this site. </p><p>This website was created using Python, Javascript and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The data is collected &amp; processed every 10 mins with Python on AWS Lambda so it can continue to run even in the event of a local power outage. The data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket tracking 24-hour segments and archiveing any days with more than a 5% statewide outage. The frontend is created using Vue.js &amp; Bootstrap 5. The charts are created with Chart.js and the map is made with leaflet.js. </p></div></div></div>',1);function n(e,t,a,n,r,d){return Object(i["q"])(),Object(i["d"])("div",s,[o])}var r={name:"About"};a("7210");r.render=n;t["default"]=r}}]);
