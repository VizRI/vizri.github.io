My goal is to provide a user-friendly platform that allows you to easily track the election contests that matter most to you, for both primary and general elections. </p><p class="fs-5"> The website is designed to present the count of votes as reported by the Rhode Island Board of Elections raw data files. By design, it never declares a candidate as the &quot;winner&quot; with an icon or mark. The site is purely for informational purposes. </p><p class="fs-5"> There are several pages, &quot;Statewide&quot; which will show all statewide races such as President, Governor or Congress. &quot;Senate&quot; which shows all state senator races, &quot;House&quot; showing all house of representatives races. &quot;Local&quot; which will show all elections voted on within the chosen city/town and lastly &quot;Custom&quot; allowing you to pick and choose specific races you wish to track. </p><p class="fs-5"> This site is designed by Alex (SmirkyGraphs). The backend, built with Python &amp; AWS, collects and processes data with Python on AWS Lambda, and stores it in an AWS S3 bucket. The frontend, originally written in Flask, was later transitioned to Vue3 with Bootstrap 5 for styling. </p></div></div>',1),n=[i];function r(l,c){return s(),t("main",null,n)}const h=e(a,[["render",r]]);export{h as default};
