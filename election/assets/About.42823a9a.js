You can view contests through one of the pre-set pages or pick and choose specifically which contests you care about through the Custom page. </p><p class="fs-5"> The website is designed to show the count of votes as reported by Rhode Island Board of Elections raw data files. By design, it never declares a candidate as the &quot;winner&quot; with an icon or mark and is for informational purposes only. </p><p class="fs-5"> There are several pages, &quot;Statewide&quot; which will show all statewide races such as President, Governor or Congress. &quot;Senate&quot; which shows all state senator races, &quot;House&quot; showing all house of representatives races. &quot;Local&quot; which will show all elections voted on within the chosen city/town and lastly &quot;Custom&quot; allowing you to pick and choose specific races you wish to track. </p><p class="fs-5"> This site was created by Alex (SmirkyGraphs). The site was made using Python, AWS and Vuejs. The backend is Python &amp; AWS, the data is collected &amp; processed with Python on AWS Lambda, then stored in a AWS S3 bucket. The frontend was originally written in Flask and later changed to Vue with Bootstrap 5 for styling. </p></div></div>',1),n=[i];function r(c,l){return t(),o("main",null,n)}var d=e(a,[["render",r]]);export{d as default};
